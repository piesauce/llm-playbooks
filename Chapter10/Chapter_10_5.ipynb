Part I provides a simple technical explanation of how large language models work, why there is a gap in available data between English and other languages, and how multilingual language models attempt to bridge that gap. Part II accounts for the challenges of doing content analysis with large language models in general and multilingual language models in particular. Part III offers recommendations for companies, researchers, and policymakers to keep in mind when considering researching, developing and deploying large and multilingual language models.' \n",

      "\n",
      "However, if the problem statement asked for a specific part of the summary, the final answer would be different. For example, if the problem statement asked for the first sentence of the summary, the final answer would be: 'In recent years, large language models (e.g., Open AI's GPT-4, Meta's LLaMa, Google's PaLM) have become the dominant approach for building AI systems to analyze and generate language online.' \n",

      "Similarly, if the problem statement asked for the title of the paper, the final answer would be: 'Lost in Translation: Large Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis.' \n",

      "In general, the final answer would depend on the specific requirements of the problem statement. \n",
