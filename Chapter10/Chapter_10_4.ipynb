    "LLM jailbreaking refers to techniques used to bypass the safety measures and constraints implemented in large language models. \n",
    "These attempts aim to make the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reveal its system prompt/instructions\n",
    "2. Generate harmful, unethical, or prohibited content\n",
    "3. Bypass content filters or moderation systems\n",
    "4. Impersonate specific entities or characters that may act without constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "System prompt extraction is particularly problematic as it can expose:\n",
    "- Internal security measures\n",
    "- The model's operational constraints\n",
    "- Proprietary prompt engineering techniques\n",
    "- Information that could be used for further exploitation\n",
